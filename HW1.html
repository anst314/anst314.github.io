        <h2="Expectations">Expectations</h2>

            <p>I am looking forward to learning as much as I can during the
                boot camp. I understand that it is going to be rigorous and
                overwhelming at times. I expect to learn front and back end
                of web development thoroughly. I understand that it takes
                dedication and I am up for the task.

            <h3>Why Per Scholas</h3>

            <p id="PerScholas">I chose Per Scholas primarily because there was no cost tuition.
                Also after musch schepticizm and some research...I saw that they
                were a legit program. I'm glad that I was told about them.
